Code Scanner is a little AIR Tool that let's you count the number of lines you wrote in your ActionScript project, additionally scans how many classes were defined, function, ifs, etc.

You can also pass packages to be left out as you maybe don't want to take credit for any libaries you included.

It is not really hard core tested, but I thought sharing is caring.
